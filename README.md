# 🚦 AI-Powered Smart Traffic Management System

An intelligent and scalable traffic control solution that harnesses the power of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Computer Vision** to optimize real-time traffic flow. Using **YOLOv8** object detection and **custom UI controls**, this system detects and classifies vehicles from live video feeds and adjusts signal timings dynamically based on vehicle density and type.

Built to address the ever-growing traffic challenges in urban environments, this system offers a practical AI-driven alternative to traditional, static traffic systems. 🌆🚗

## 🔧 Key Features

✨ The project includes the following major features:

- 🎯 **Real-Time Vehicle Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv8 to detect and classify vehicles such as cars, buses, trucks, and two-wheelers with high accuracy.
  
- 📹 **Multi-Lane Support:** Processes video input from **four different lanes simultaneously**, enabling accurate traffic analysis at busy intersections.

- 🚦 **Dynamic Signal Timing:** Adjusts green light durations based on the density and type of vehicles in each lane — improving traffic efficiency and reducing wait times.

- 🖱️ **Custom GUI (Tkinter):** User-friendly **customtkinter** interface for selecting regions of interest (ROI) in video feeds — essential for accurate vehicle detection in specific areas.

- ⚡ **Optimized Performance:** Ensures real-time speed and smooth detection, even with multiple live video streams.

- 🧠 **AI for Smart Cities:** Demonstrates how AI technologies can be integrated into city infrastructure for automation, efficiency, and better urban living.
